APPLICATION OF PROCESS MINING TECHNIQUES TO INVOICE PROCESS

Abstract 
Process mining is one of the newest and most sought-after fields of data mining in business process analysis, used to increase quality, reduce costs, and identify process risks.
Process mining allows us to find large and complicated process flows and analyze deviations, bottlenecks, and anomalies from historical data, called event logs. The techniques include process discovery (finding models from an event log), compliance checking (studying deviations), and enhancement (improving the model). Furthermore, the discover processes can have three perspectives: control flow (cases), performance (timing), and organization (social).
This report addresses the analysis and process mining of a multinational packaging solutions company's shared service center's purchase-to-pay system. Four possible processed invoice flows were implemented using the available data. Moreover, some key performance indicators regarding duplicated and automated rates are defined and measured. For implementation, an R package - bupaR, was used as a process mining software tool and Tableau as a business intelligence tool.
